                      Suisse AI is a company focused on AI safety and research, striving to develop reliable, interpretable, and controllable AI systems. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, disclose, and otherwise process your personal data on our website and other platforms where Suisse AI acts as a data controller and links to this Privacy Policy—for instance, when you utilize Suisse AI’s APIs or other consumer products for personal usage ("Services"). It does not pertain to personal data we receive, process, store, or host when you access Suisse AI’s AI services as or via an enterprise customer, unless explicitly mentioned in this policy. In such cases, you engage with us via the enterprise customer company, and their privacy policy should be consulted for more information about their handling of your personal data.
                      <br />
                      <br />
1. Collection of Personal Data
                      We accumulate the following categories of personal data when you engage with our Services, including if you have a Suisse AI account on our Services. We need this data to provide you with our Services, which may enable you to utilize our API or interact with our AI services through various interfaces.
                      Personal Data Provided to our Website:
                      Identifiers: Suisse AI may gather identifiers, such as your name and email when you register for a Suisse AI account, to receive updates on our Services, or apply for an employment opportunity. Without this data, we will be unable to administer your Suisse AI account. We may also accumulate indirect identifiers (e.g., “USER12345”).
                      Financial Data: We will gather your payment data if you decide to purchase Suisse AI’s products and services via the Services. Without this data, we will be unable to facilitate your purchase of Suisse AI’s products and services.
                      Professional Data: If you use our Services to apply for a job, Suisse AI may gather professional data that you provide, like your resume.
                      Internet or other Electronic Network Activity Data: When you use our AI services, we collect your Prompts to generate Results (as defined in our Terms of Use), which may be associated with identifiers relating to you. If you include personal data in your Prompts, we will also process that data. However, Prompts and Results are subject to strict retention periods, as stated below in Section 8.
                      Feedback on your use of our Services: Where applicable, we will gather your Feedback (as defined in our Terms of Use) regarding Prompts and Results and use it to train and enhance our Services. This might occur if, for instance, you report that Claude returned inaccurate data in a Result, or if you rate a Result to your Prompt using the thumbs-up/thumbs-down icon. We may also collect and use this data for the same purposes when you use our enterprise services.
                      Personal Data We Automatically Receive from Your Use of the Website:
                      When you access and use the Services, Suisse AI may automatically receive the following data:
                      Internet or other Electronic Network Activity Data, including your device type;
                      IP address (including data about the location of the device derived from your IP address);
                      Device or Advertising Identifiers, probabilistic identifiers, and other unique personal or online identifiers;
                      Data about your device and operating system, such as time zone setting and location, operating system and platform;
                      Data about your browser, such as browser type and version, browser plugin types and versions;
                      Internet service provider;
                      Pages that you visit before and after the website, browsing history, search history, and the date and time of your visit;
                      Data about the links you click, pages you view, and advertising you engage with within the website and other data about how you use the Services;
                      The technology on the devices you use to access the Services; and
                      Standard server log data.
                      If you or your device experiences an error, we may gather data about the error, the time the error occurred, the feature being used, the state of the application when the error occurred, and any communications or content provided at the time the error occurred.
                      In these contexts, Suisse AI receives personal data from the following categories of sources: directly from you, such as when you engage with the Suisse AI website, and from internet service providers.

6. Third-Party Websites and Services
                      Our Services may involve interactions with, or may guide you to, websites, apps, and services governed by third parties. By engaging with these third parties, you acknowledge that you are providing information directly to the third party and not to Suisse AI, and that it is subject to the third party's privacy policy.

For Services, other than the Suisse AI API, we may retain Prompts and Results as needed to provide the Service. As an example, if a Service enables you to save and continue conversations, we retain the Prompts and Results to ensure a consistent product experience over time.
                      When evaluating how long to retain your personal data, we consider criteria such as: (i) the nature of the personal data and the activities involved; (ii) when and how long you interact with Suisse AI; and (iii) our legitimate interests and legal obligations. In all situations, we may retain Prompts and Results as mandated by law or as necessary to combat violations of our Acceptable Use Policy.
