                      These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a binding legal contract between you and Suisse AI AG (“Suisse AI”, “we”, or “us”). Our Terms regulate your access to and utilization of our website, products, and services, inclusive of their web interfaces, application programming interfaces ("APIs"), additional software, tools, services, documentation, content, intellectual property, and functions we may provide (collectively referred to as our “Services”).

                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Before using our Services, we advise you to carefully peruse our Terms. Acceptance of our Terms or the subsequent access or use of our Services signifies your consent to be bound by and adhere to our Terms, and signifies that you have read and understand our Privacy Policy and Acceptable Use Policy. If you are in disagreement with our Terms, or if you object to our Privacy Policy or Acceptable Use Policy, please refrain from accessing or using our Services.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Should you accept our Terms on behalf of a company, organization, or another entity, you affirm and declare that you are authorized to bind the company, organization, or other entity for whom you are accepting our Terms—you and such entity, collectively, are referred to as “you” in this context—and you agree on behalf of that entity that such entity is bound by our Terms. If you are accepting our Terms for yourself, then you agree to be personally bound by our Terms—here, you are “you” individually.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      <b>Alterations to Terms</b>

                      <br />
                      1. Our Terms may be revised and updated periodically, at our sole discretion. If you persist in the use of our Services following the posting of the updated Terms on our Services or following the provision of such notice of changes, this implies that you accept and agree to the updated Terms. If you reject the updated Terms, you must cease to access or use our Services.
                      <br />
                      <br />

                      <br />
                      The use of specific Services may necessitate your acceptance of additional terms. These terms will supplement our Terms with respect to those Services and may revise or update your rights or obligations regarding those Services, including your obligations to pay fees.
