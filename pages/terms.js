                      These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a binding legal contract between you and Suisse AI AG (“Suisse AI”, “we”, or “us”). Our Terms regulate your access to and utilization of our website, products, and services, inclusive of their web interfaces, application programming interfaces ("APIs"), additional software, tools, services, documentation, content, intellectual property, and functions we may provide (collectively referred to as our “Services”).

                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Before using our Services, we advise you to carefully peruse our Terms. Acceptance of our Terms or the subsequent access or use of our Services signifies your consent to be bound by and adhere to our Terms, and signifies that you have read and understand our Privacy Policy and Acceptable Use Policy. If you are in disagreement with our Terms, or if you object to our Privacy Policy or Acceptable Use Policy, please refrain from accessing or using our Services.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Should you accept our Terms on behalf of a company, organization, or another entity, you affirm and declare that you are authorized to bind the company, organization, or other entity for whom you are accepting our Terms—you and such entity, collectively, are referred to as “you” in this context—and you agree on behalf of that entity that such entity is bound by our Terms. If you are accepting our Terms for yourself, then you agree to be personally bound by our Terms—here, you are “you” individually.
                      <br />
                      <br />

If you persist in the use of our Services following the posting of the updated Terms on our Services or following the provision of such notice of changes, this implies that you accept and agree to the updated Terms. If you reject the updated Terms, you must cease to access or use our Services.
                      <br />
                      <br />

                        YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS THE SUISSE AI PARTIES FROM ANY LIABILITIES, CLAIMS, DAMAGES, EXPENSES (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS), AND OTHER LOSSES ARISING OUT OF YOUR BREACH OR ALLEGED BREACH OF THESE TERMS, YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES OR THE MATERIALS, YOUR FEEDBACK, ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THAT YOU DEVELOP, OFFER, OR MAKE AVAILABLE USING OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES, YOUR VIOLATION OF ANY APPLICABLE LAW OR THIRD-PARTY RIGHT, AND ANY ALLEGED OR ACTUAL FRAUD, INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT, GROSS NEGLIGENCE, OR CRIMINAL ACTS COMMITTED BY YOU OR YOUR EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS.

You can also terminate our Terms at any time, for any reason, by discontinuing your access to and use of the Services. Upon termination, the rights granted to you under our Terms to access and use the Services will cease immediately, and you must destroy all Confidential Information in your possession or control.

                        <br />
                        <br />
14. Miscellaneous Provisions
                        Additional Conditions: In utilizing our Services, you are obligated to adhere to any guidelines, rules, or additional terms related to these Services, which may be updated on the Services periodically. Should we request that you evaluate and accept any additional terms which contradict our Terms directly, the additional terms will take precedence over our Terms with regard to your usage of the specific Services controlled by these additional terms, only in the instance of such contradiction.
                        Complete Agreement; Non-Transferable: Our Terms, along with any other terms included by reference, form the comprehensive agreement between you and us pertaining to the subject matter of our Terms. Without our prior written consent, our Terms cannot be transferred or assigned by you, however, we may assign them without limitation.
                        Equitable Remedy: You agree that, if you breach Section 4 (Use Rights, Requirements, and Restrictions), Section 11 (Confidentiality), or Section 14 (Arbitration), (a) there are no sufficient remedies available at law; (b) it would be challenging to quantify the damages from such breach, and any such breach would inflict irreversible harm; and (c) injunctive relief provides the optimal remedy for any such breach. Consequently, you renounce any opposition to such injunctive relief and any demand that we demonstrate actual damage or post a bond or other security in connection with such injunctive relief.
                        Absence of Joint Venture, Partnership, Employment, or Agency Relationship: You acknowledge that our Terms or your access to or usage of the Services does not create a joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship between you and us.
                        Non-Sponsorship: Without our previous written consent, you may not use our name, logo, or other trademarks to endorse products or services other than the Services, or in any other way that implies our affiliation, endorsement, or sponsorship.
                        Severability: If a court or other legal body of competent jurisdiction deems any provision of our Terms invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision will be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent required to align with applicable law, ensuring that the remaining provisions of our Terms continue in full force and effect.
                        Non-Waiver: Any waiver by us of any term or condition set forth in our Terms will not be considered a subsequent or continuing waiver of such term or condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure by us to assert a right or provision under our Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
                        Legal Compliance: We may conform to governmental, court, and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to the provision or use of the Services, or to information provided to or gathered under our Terms. We retain the right, at our sole discretion, to report Prompts or Results to law enforcement.
                        Governing Law; Exclusive Jurisdiction: Our Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Canton Zug of Switzerland, without considering conflict of law principles. If a lawsuit or court proceeding is allowed under our Terms, you and Suisse AI agree that any such dispute will be litigated in the state or federal courts located in Canton Zug in Switzerland, and you and Suisse AI submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of those courts. By using the Services, you renounce any claims that may arise under the laws of other jurisdictions.
                        Government Usage: The Services were exclusively developed at private expense and are commercial computer software and commercial computer software documentation within the purview of the relevant Federal Acquisition Regulations and their agency supplements. Therefore, Government users of the Services will have only those rights that are granted to all other end users of the Services under these Terms.
                        Export and Sanctions: You are prohibited from exporting or providing access to the Services into any U.S. embargoed countries or to anyone on (i) the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals, (ii) any other restricted party lists identified by the Office of Foreign Asset Control, (iii) the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Persons List or Entity List, or (iv) any other restricted party lists.
